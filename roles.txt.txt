3.3 Division of Labor
We worked in almost total collaboration for the entire project, but for certain sections one of us would take the lead. Daniel tended to take the lead on sections dealing with the actual data, while Saul worked on ways to manipulate the data. For example, Daniel took the lead on working with FAVE, both the alignment and the extraction as well as the KNN classifier. Saul came up with the concept for the project and worked on reformatting the TIMIT data. He also worked on finding a way to average the formant values, and took the lead on the presentation and the writeup.
